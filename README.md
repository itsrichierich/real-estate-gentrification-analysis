# Gentrification Data Lab

This project is a hands-on data journalism toolkit designed to help investigative journalists analyze real estate sales data to uncover gentrification patterns in U.S. cities.

It uses cleaned data scraped from Redfin's "Sold" listings and provides an interactive environment (Google Colab + pandas) for filtering, analyzing, and visualizing trends by ZIP code, neighborhood, and time.

## Purpose

**Investigative Goal:**  
Track how neighborhoods are changing by identifying:
- Rising property values
- Investor (LLC) purchases
- Flipping patterns
- Price per sq. ft. inflation
- ZIP code-specific trends

This is ideal for stories about:
- Displacement and affordability
- Predatory investment or redevelopment
- Uneven neighborhood development

## How to Use This Project

1. Open the `interactive_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Clean and explore the real estate dataset
3. Choose a ZIP code or neighborhood of interest
4. Visualize price trends, buyer types, and price per square foot
5. Record your insights, leads, or story angles

---

## Reporting Ideas

- What ZIP codes saw the highest jump in sale price per sq. ft?
- Are majority of the buyers individuals or LLCs?
- Do any LLCs appear repeatedly across the dataset?
- Is there a neighborhood or zip code where homes are flipping rapidly?
- What do the trends suggest about affordability and access?
